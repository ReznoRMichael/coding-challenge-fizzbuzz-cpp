# Coding Challenge (FizzBuzz)

## General info

Learning C++. Completed FizzBuzz Coding Challenge in 14 minutes (07.07.2019).
The first completion was quick, wasn't easily expandable and didn't follow best programming practices, so I wanted to refactor the code using what I learned so far.
I hope to go back to this code as I learn and improve it even more, make it reusable and more expandable, easy to change.
